# MySQL-Data-Cleaning-and-EDA

This is a small MySQL project where I used a online data set with information of layoffs made by companies over the past few years. After importing this data into my database I cleaned it using various methods to ensure the data was useful and easy to work with when I peformed my exploritory data analysis. I then performed my exploritory data analysis to extract meaningful information from the data set and present it in a readable manner.
